The project in its current state deals with two entity sets (students and faculty/admin). Per discussion with Professor Abello, in order to make the project a bit more interesting, we propose an alternative/extension to the project presented to this point. The alternative project will consider three entity sets instead of two. These entity sets are: TAs, Faculty, and Classes. The relationship between these entity sets represents a real world problem that the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University faces every semester. That problem is matching potential TA's with the classes they wish to assist, and with faculty. This is essentially the classic problem of 3D Matching. The 3D Macthing problem is NP-Hard which makes it a difficult problem to solve algorithmically. This creates an opportunity to develop an interface for human-computer interaction in which a user aids the search algorithm in finding a solution in an efficient amount of time. This idea will be explored further and presented in future updates to this project proposal.
