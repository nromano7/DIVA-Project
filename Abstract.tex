The Rutgers Administrative Management System (RAM) will extend the Graduate Course Request System (GCRS) idea that was originally proposed by this group. In our previous proposal, GCRS was described as a system that would allow for easier and faster delivery and approval of graduate course requests for undergraduate students that incorporated a multi-purpose interactive "Visual Transcript", which provides an interface for visualizing and extracting useful information from a student's course history. The RAM system is a close relative to the GCRS. RAM System will still include the Visual Transcript component described in the original project proposal, however the RAM system will consider a different use case; that is, the RAM system will provide an interface for efficiently matching potential teaching assistant's with courses and faculty who require a teaching assistant. A generality of this use case is the well known 3D-Matching problem. The RAM system will implement an approximation algorithm for 3D matching and will incorporate visual components to allow for human-computer interaction in order to find a maximal matching of the three entity sets.
