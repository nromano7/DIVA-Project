The Rutgers TA Allocation System (RTAS) is a web application that takes a list of Teaching Assistant (TA) applications as input, processes them using a 3D-Matching algorithm, and allows the user to provide feedback to the algorithm through human-computer interaction in order to extract a collection of approved TA applications that the user is satisfied with. Each TA application is a 3-tuple from the cross-product of three entity sets: the TAs submitting applications, professors, and courses. A generality of this use case is the well known 3D-Matching problem, which is an NP-hard problem where the goal is to find an optimal matching between TAs, professors, and courses. The RTAS will use an approximation algorithm to perform its processing, and it will provide a visual interface that will allow the user to provide feedback to the approximation algorithm in hopes of returning a better output.
