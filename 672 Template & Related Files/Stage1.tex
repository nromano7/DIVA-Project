\textnormal{
Get a realistic project idea that includes potential real world scenarios,
with a description of the different user types along with their interactions with the system 
as well as the system feedback to them, according to their information needs. 
This stage also requires the specification of the different constraints and restrictions
that need to be enforced depending on the different types of user (system interactions). 
The deliverables for this stage include the following items:
} 

\begin{itemize} 
\item{A general description (in plain English) of your project's deliverables (understandable by computer illiterate users).} 

\item{ A specific description of at least three types of users. }
	
\item{ A description of detailed real world scenarios (at least 2 scenarios) representing those typical interactions between the different user types and the system (including inputs and outputs and data types).}
	

\item{A description of detailed real world scenarios (at least 2 scenarios) representing those typical interactions between the different user types and the system (including inputs and outputs and data types). }

\item{A detailed time line for completion of the major implementaion stages together with the division of labor including testing, documentation, evaluaton, project report, and power point presentation.}

\end{itemize}
